# ComputerVision

This project implements various computer vision techniques


Description: 

    The projects are:
    
            1. Image Filtering – This program uses convolution and correlation to implement various filters on images.
                                The filters used are mean, gaussian, sharpening, and median.
                                The two sample images used by this program are: lena.png and art.png.
                                
            2. Canny Edge Detection – This program implements the various steps in Canny edge detection.
                                The steps are Gaussian smoothing, calculating image gradient, suppressing nonmaxima, and edge linking.
                                The two sample images used by this program are: lena_gray.png and test.png.
